This is a game I wrote as an assignment for Zed Shaw's book
[Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/).
It is a command-line RPG in the style of early classics like
'Zork'.

It is inspired by the Ancient Greek hero Heracles (Hercules),
who completed a series of superhuman feats, and in the process
gained immortality.

This is the first proper computer program I ever wrote, and the
code reflects that.  I keep it, locally and on Github, to remind
myself where I started, and as a project I can refactor at will.
